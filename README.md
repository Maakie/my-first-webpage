# My first webpage

#### My website, 8/12/2019

#### By **Sharmarke Mohamed**

## Description

 This is my first webpage. It's barebones currently but will be adding to it as my skills grow.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the repo
* Open file 

Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?

## Known Bugs

There are no bugs currently.

## Support and contact details

If you have any concerns or suggestions, you an reach me at makieto202@gmail.com

## Technologies Used

Currently only working with HTML. CSS and JS to come as the website grows.
